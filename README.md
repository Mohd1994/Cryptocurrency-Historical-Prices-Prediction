# Cryptocurrency-Historical-Prices-Prediction
This code is a machine learning script that uses multiple regression models to predict the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies. It first imports necessary libraries including pandas, numpy, sklearn and statsmodels. 

# About Proposal:

The CNN-Daily Mail News Text Summarization dataset is a collection of news articles and summaries of those articles. It was created to help train and evaluate natural language processing models for the task of text summarization. 

Text summarization is the process of generating a concise and coherent summary of a longer text document, The CNN-Daily Mail dataset contains more than 300,000 pairs of news articles and summaries, with each summary being a shortened version of the corresponding article. The summaries were created by professional editors, so they serve as a good reference for evaluating the performance of text summarization models.

# The Purpose of the project

The purpose of the Text Summarization is to provide a large, high-quality work for researchers to use in developing and evaluating text summarization models. It is a widely used dataset in the field of natural language processing and has been used in many research papers and projects.

# Target Audience:

The target audience for the Text Summarization is primarily researchers and practitioners in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. The dataset is intended for use in developing and evaluating text summarization models, which are a common application of NLP and machine learning techniques.

Text Summarization may also be of interest to journalists, educators, and other professionals who work with large volumes of text and who may be interested in using text summarization tools to help them process and understand the content.

However, the primary target audience for the Text Summarization is the NLP and machine learning research community, as it provides a large, high-quality dataset that can be used to train and evaluate text summarization models.



# Goals and Objectives

The main goal of text summarization is to create a concise and coherent summary of a longer text document, while preserving the important information and main points of the original text. There are several objectives that text summarization systems aim to achieve:

•	Reduction of the text length: The primary objective of text summarization is to produce a shorter version of the original text, while maintaining its meaning and key points. This can be useful for saving time and making it easier to digest large amounts of information.

•	Preservation of important information: It is important that text summarization systems retain the key points and important information from the original text. A good summary should accurately represent the main ideas and content of the original text.

•	Coherence: The summary should be a cohesive and coherent text, rather than a random collection of sentences or phrases.

•	Fluency: The summary should be written in a clear and natural language that is easy to understand.

•	Relevance: The summary should cover only the most important and relevant information from the original text.

Text summarization can be useful for a variety of applications, such as information retrieval, content management, and news filtering. It can help people quickly process and understand large amounts of information and stay updated on the latest developments in their fields of interest.


#	Project Plane:

•	Collect and pre-process the data: First, you will need to gather a dataset of text documents and corresponding summaries. You will then need to pre-process the data by cleaning it, tokenizing it, and possibly performing other steps such as stemming or lemmatization.

•	Train the model: Next, you can use GPT-3 to train a text summarization model on the dataset. This will involve feeding the model the text documents and their corresponding 

summaries and adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the error between the model's predictions and the true summaries.

•	Evaluate the model: After training the model, you will need to evaluate its performance to see how well it is able to generate accurate summaries. You can use metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score to measure the model's performance.

•	Fine-tune the model: If the model's performance is not satisfactory, you can try fine-tuning the model by adjusting its hyperparameters or using different training techniques.

•	Deploy the model: Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, you can deploy it in a production environment, such as an API or a web application, to make predictions on new text documents.

•	It is important to note that this is just a general outline, and the specific steps and details will depend on the specific requirements and goals of your project.
